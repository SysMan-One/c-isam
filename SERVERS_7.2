I.      OVERVIEW OF RELEASE NOTES

        The purpose of these release notes is to make you aware of
        changes in products that might affect existing applications.
        The release notes contain information on changes from previous

        This release notes document is not intended to be all-inclusive;
        it is a tool to assist you in the update process. Please consult
        Informix product manuals for additional information on product
        features and for clarification of product behavior.

III.    NEW FEATURES


        Increased Maximum File Size Limits
        ==================================

        INFORMIX-SE, Version 7.25.UC1 expands storage capabilities
        of the database.  INFORMIX-SE, Version 7.24 (and earlier releases)
        supported data files, index files, audit files and transaction log
        files of up to only 2GB. This limit on file sizes is increased.
        If file size is constrained by your available system hardware,
        your actual limit might be lower.

        LIMITS IN INFORMIX-SE
        ---------------------

        Number of indexes................................No logical limit
        Max Bytes per index...........................................120
        Max number of columns in composite index........................8
        Number of tables.................................No logical limit
        Row size...................................................32,511
        Maximum number of rows..............................2,147,483,647
        Maximum data file size.................................1TB (2^40)
        Maximum index file size................................1TB (2^40)
        Maximum transaction log file size......................8EB (2^63)
        Maximum audit trail file size..........................8EB (2^63)

        Note: The increased file size limits, mentioned above, are
              applicable only for platforms and operating systems that
              support special APIs for accessing large files. For more
              details, check the Machine Notes file.

        New Transaction Log Format
        ==========================

        Transaction-file records contain a fixed-length header
        and other information that depends on the transaction type.
        The first record header starts at an offset of 4 bytes
        from the beginnig of the file. (The first 4 bytes of the
        file contain a unique reserved number).

        Byte     Number
        Offset   of Bytes          Item
        ======   ========          ======================

        New Error Messages
        ==================

        Two new error messages are introduced in this release.

        ERROR   DESCRIPTION
        =====   ===========
        -21501  ISAM error:  Record Overflow : Unable to Insert a Row.
                SE/C-ISAM was unable to insert a row because the file
                already contains  2^31 -1 (2147483647) rows.
                You have reached the maximum number of rows for this
                file.  Delete some rows before you add more rows.

        -21502  ISAM error:  Incompatible log file format.
                The transaction log file format is incompatible with
                the SE/C-ISAM version being used.  This could be
                because the transaction log file was created using
                an older version of SE/C-ISAM.
                Ensure that the transaction log file is used by the
                same version of SE/C-ISAM that created it, so that
                the log file format is compatible.



IV.     MIGRATION ISSUES

        This release is a seamless upgrade for INFORMIX-SE,
        Version 7.2x customers. There are no SQL syntax changes or
        API changes from the previous version of INFORMIX-SE.
        There are no changes in the format of data files, index files
        or audit trail files. Because of the changes in the transaction
        log file format, however, this version cannot open transaction
        log files that contain transaction records in the legacy format.



V.      CAVEATS

        Incompatibilities with Earlier Transaction Logs
        ===============================================

        Because of file format differences between Version 7.25.UC1
        and Version 7.24 (and earlier), INFORMIX-SE 7.25.UC1
        cannot recover data from a transaction log file
        that was created using older versions of INFORMIX-SE.
        This version of INFORMIX-SE cannot read transaction log files
        that were written in the old format, and older versions of
        INFORMIX-SE cannot read transaction logs in the new format.

        Use of the selog utility provided with INFORMIX-SE Version 7.24
        or earlier is not supported for files created by Version 7.25.UC1.

        Any transaction log file that combines records in both the
        old and new formats is unreadable by any version of INFORMIX-SE,
        and therefore cannot be used to recover data. If an older
        version of INFORMIX-SE writes legacy-format records into a
        Version 7.25.UC1 transaction log, then that log file becomes
        corrupt.
